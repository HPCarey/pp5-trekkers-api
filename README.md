#### **ERD Plan for backend models**
 * The plan for this project is based on the Code Institute Moments walkthrough project. 
 * Most of the models are the same except for the post model which has been customised to better suit the needs of the site owner and users.
 * Initial plans were to include an event model, but that has been assigned as a future feature to help focus on the minimal viable product of  the site.
